## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-28

### Added

#### PBS-PRIO-01
- **Section 14: NASA DSN Compatibility** — Documents the relationship between PBS 5-level priority classes and NASA Deep Space Network 7-level scheduling system.
  - Section 14.1: Scope Differentiation (packet-layer vs. ground scheduling)
  - Section 14.2: Informative priority mapping table
  - Section 14.3: Interoperability notes for DSN-serviced missions

### Purpose
This addition clarifies that PBS operates as complementary packet-layer scheduling within DSN-allocated antenna time, enabling commercial operators to implement NASA-compatible prioritization without modifying DSN infrastructure.
